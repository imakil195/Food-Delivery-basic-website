# 🍴 FoodieCart — Food Delivery (HTML/CSS/JS)

A simple food delivery web app to practice **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It includes an interactive menu, **add/remove to cart**, **quantity updates**, and a fully working **cart UI** that recalculates totals in real time. Great as a starter project to learn DOM manipulation, events, and basic state management in vanilla JS.
